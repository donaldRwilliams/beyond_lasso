# Beyond Lasso: A Survey of Nonconvex Regularization in Gaussian Graphical Models

This repo contains R code to reproduce the simulations in Williams (2020). 

## File Descriptions

* synthetic_sim.Rmd: This code will reproduce the simulations in the section titled "Synthetic Partial Correlations."
  * synthetic_conditions.csv: This file must be downloaded. It includes the simulation conditions.
  * functions.R: This file includes the function GGMncv_search. This will be in the new version of **GGMncv**, 
    but for now this file is needed to reproduce the simulations.

* empirical_sim.Rmd: This code will reproduce the simulations in the section titled "Empirical Partial Correlations."
  * functions.R: This file includes the function GGMncv_search. This will be in the new version of **GGMncv**, 
    but for now this file is needed to reproduce the simulations.
